Main objectve of this exercise is to create a prediction model to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. 

Overall analysis is that Odometer reading and age of the car are major factors which decide the price of the car.

Age is interesting since it seems the price of the car more than 60 years old is also high since it becomes a collectable.

Overall recommendation to the dealers is to get cars with less age and less odometer readings. 
Dealers should not get cars with less age and high odometer readings.

### Next steps
Additional data about the cars with features like modification, Audio/video features would be helpful to further train and test the data.
RandomForestRegressor seems to have better. Further data cleaning can be looked into for better prediction model.
